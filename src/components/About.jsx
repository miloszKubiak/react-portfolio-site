            I am a computer science student and I am currently at the stage of
            writing an engineering thesis. I am mainly interested in the frontend, but I also had a little bit of work with the backend. I'm currently learning React and want to learn TypeScript in the near future.
            In my free time (of which there is very, very littleðŸ¤£) I like playing video games, especially RPGs like the Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077 or World of Warcraft.
